# End Period Poverty Website 
HTML/CSS with JavaScript functional website for Bristol campaign group.

## Motivations behind End Period Poverty
As the cost of living crisis continues, rates of period poverty in the UK have risen from 12% to 21% (Pycroft, 2023). According to France Williams (2022), that equals 1 in 4 people in the UK. We believe menstrual health should be recognized as a basic human right. Nobody should be excluding themselves from social situations because of their period. Nobody should feel ashamed and embarrassed when on their period. Everybody should have access to free, hygienic, high-quality period products.
